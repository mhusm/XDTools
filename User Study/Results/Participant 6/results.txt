Comments:
- started by looking at code for xdyt-bug a long time before trying to reproduce bug
- hints: Use JS console, why should shift fail
- xdyt-impl: implemented everything including css, then tested it
- no jQuery used
- pause/unpaused verwechselt
- xdc-bug: started with function debugging (setLocation, getCinemaLocation)
- when does Chrome DevTools lose hook for iframes?
- no real devices used
- xdc-impl: started by creating two devices and looking for the prices-title
- xdc-impl: implemented both functions before testing
- removed class highlighted right from the start
- used shared JS console including stack trace
- used shared CSS editor for changing class highlighted
- feature: timestamp with console outputs, arguments that caused function to fail?
- xdc-impl hint: space in id
- tried a lot of CSS for highlighting (border, border-radius, bg-color)

- sehr hilfreich f√ºr XD Applikationsentwicklung
- The existing features are already very impressive and work well. They really help the developer working on cross device applications.
