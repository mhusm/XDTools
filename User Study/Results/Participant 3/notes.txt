Task completion times:
xdc-bug: 3216.772, ~ 7 min
xdc-impl: 1113.654 = 18.5
xdyt-bug: ~ 16 min
xdyt-impl: 1040.717
 = 17.35 min

Notes:
- used Chrome DevTools breakpoints in function, looked at variables inside function with console
- tried out getCinemas in the console
- did not use shared console for xdyt-bug
- function debugging had some problems
- xdyt-impl: scoping used for trying out functions within shared console
- css autocomplete did not work that well
- added a lot of css to the button compared to the other participants

Comments by the participant: 
- not obvious if function debugging works and when to open the developer tools
- it would be great if devtools opened as soon as you click inspect in function debugging
- some way of knowing what functions there are (e.g. auto-complete) or being able to select line numbers would be great for function debugging
- "I think it is very useful for cross-device applications and wish I had access to it when I was working on a cross-device application last year."
