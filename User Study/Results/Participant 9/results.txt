XDYT with tools
XDC without tools

Comments:
- the only participant that found the error in xdyt-bug without help
- debugging strategy: (xdyt-bug): reproduced bug, fixed bug
- started by implementing everything, then testing and debugging (xdyt-impl)
- experience with FF devtools, but not with Chrome devtools
- xdc-bug solved after 4 minutes --> the tools are obviously rated as efficient and easy if the error is found almost immediately
- connection problems in XDC during implementation
- useful that everything can be seen in one window, especially javascript console
- user should see on which device the function is called
- Comment about xdc-impl: "Switching around between browser windows to interact with them and especially having to reload them individually is tedious
