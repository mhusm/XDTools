Notes:
- Participant successfully completed all tasks
- Participant did not use real devices for any task
- no jQuery used, but tutorial used
- xdyt-impl: participant implemented both functions completely before testing anything, edited css in file and reloaded device

Hints given:
- xdc-bug: Bug in function getCinemaLocation

Comments by the participant:
- border of device should be in color of the device
- emulating devices is very useful for implementing
- Reloading all devices at once without them losing connection is very useful
- Features were not useful for xdc-bug
- function debugging useful for debugging
- would not use JS console for sending commands, but aggregation of all device consoles is useful
- function debugging should show on which device the function is called
