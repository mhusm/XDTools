xdyt-bug: 16 Min

xdyt-impl: 283.857 + 1614.769 = 31.64 min

XDYT with tools, XDC without tools

Notes:
- Function debugging did not work (in the study, it worked during the tutorial)
- XDYT roles caused problems (always video on all devices)
- XDYT-bug: if (next) instead of length, otherwise completed
- I forgot to add an error message to the shift function
- XDYT-impl: completed
- XDC-bug: completed
- XDC-impl: completed
- used jQuery
- participant required a lot of help during xdyt-bug

Observations:
- always used one actual device (Nexus) and multiple emulated devices with tools
- no actual devices used without tools
- shared javascript console only used to look at errors (no commands sent, no console.logs in code)
- used only predefined devices
- always used auto-connect for connecting devices

Comments from the questionnaires:
- Video for the tutorial because the tool has many features
