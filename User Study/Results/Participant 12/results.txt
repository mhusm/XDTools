- xdc-bug: started by looking at code, then tested in tools
- debugged updateCinema and noticed that long is always the same but could not find the bug even though he knew on which line the bug is --> managed to find the source of the bug with the tools, but still didn't see the bug --> not a failure of the tool
- participant had huge problems with JS, did not add quotes around strings, didn't know how to add HTML elements, did not know how to correctly put brackets around if statement, ...
- used real device for xdyt-bug
- hints for xdyt-bug: look at JS console
- xdyt-impl: used the big screen for showing the video and the Nexus for controlling but then switched the big screen to device mode to debug the controller instead of remote debugging the acutal controller device
- tool would have been useful specifically for the xdyt-impl scenario
- stated that he does not do much programming
- it is useful to have multiple devices at once
