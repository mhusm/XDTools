Notes:
- xdc-bug: tried if getCinemaLocation returns the correct location using Google Maps
- xdc-impl: used color picker to try out different colors for highlighting
- non-overlapping devices would be desirable

Comments by the participant:
- auto-connect should be enabled by default --> there is rarely a reason why one would not want it
- using Chrome DevTools happens automatically, takes time to get used to different tools
- design is a bit old-fashioned, use less borders, no shadows, ...
- breakpoints not often used when debugging --> people that do not use breakpoints in normal debugging would also not use function debugging (probably)
- separated windows for emulated devices and extending devtools might be more useful
- connection features seem very natural, it's almost useless to ask if participants find them useful because it is obvious that they are useful
- it's nice that no browser profiles are needed for emulating multiple devices
- more integration with browser debugger would be good
- F5 deletes all devices (because of refresh), not necessarily what one wants --> Warning: Do you really want to refresh this window? You will lose all devices. or something like that
