Notes:
- hint: look at JS console (xdyt-bug, without tools)
- people immediately see JS errors with tools but often do not look at the console in the devtools to check for errors --> maybe because of lack of experience with devtools
- framework seems to automatically also reload connected devices (because of updating roles?) --> makes it easier to reload all devices without tools

Comments by the participant:
- It was very convenient to use. I especially liked the CSS editor and connection features. It really simplifies the process of cross-device application development when one has everything visible on one screen and does not have to switch to other devices, which might be a bit distracting.
