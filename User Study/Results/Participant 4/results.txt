XDC with tools
XDYT without tools

Notes:
- hint given: bug in getCinemaLocation
- only device emulation used in xdc-bug
- why are JS files not reloaded when reloading devices? (not related to participant, but should be fixed) Maybe the problem is with function debugging? Re-add functions when reloading device?
- xdc-impl: solved first part (displayingPrices), but couldn't finish second part
- xdyt: role assignment breaks when device resolution is changed dynamically, this only seems to be a problem without the tools because participants resize windows to switch resolutions
- no real devices used
- xdyt-impl: pause button worked, but time was not sufficient to complete the task (changing the text on the button, changing the layout of the button)
- the participants had a lot of problems using JavaScript (copied stuff like for-loops, .length, ... from other functions, didn't know basic HTML tags like "<br>") and understanding the structure of the applications in general

Comments by the participant:
- Clear UI design with useful tools for developers
- Feature suggestion: Combine source code editor with tool
