# grunt-bower-install-task

> Run bower install as a grunt task

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-bower-install-task --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, load it inside your Gruntfile and use it as part of your grunt build:

```js
//Load the task
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-bower-install-task');

//Use the task as part of your build
grunt.registerTask('init',['_bower_install_' /*, .... your other init tasks */])
```

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
