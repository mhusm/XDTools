\section{Problem Statement}

Despite the abundance of devices nowadays, up until recently there was no way of sharing state information and I/O resources between devices. Although many users have access to multiple devices at the same time, e.g. their smartphone and laptop, those devices are mostly used independently. In the last few years, cross-device applications have have started to fill this gap by facilitating the use of multiple devices at once and the sharing of data between them. The emergence of new web technologies such as Device APIs\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/}} and WebRTC\footnote{\url{http://www.webrtc.org/}} encouraged the development of a new generation of web-based frameworks that facilitate the development of cross-device applications. Such applications typically run on any device that has access to a modern web browser. Santosa et al.~\cite{santosa2013} have observed in a field study that users already use multiple devices in parallel in their workflows and that better functional coordination is needed. Despite the large number of frameworks for developing cross-device applications and the identified user needs, there are only few popular cross-device applications. Many of the available cross-device applications are prototypes to showcase the frameworks and are not accessible to the public. In order to release cross-device applications into the wild, they need to be carefully tested and bugs need to be eliminated. However, existing cross-device application development frameworks have little support for this and either provide no facilities for testing applications at all or only very basic facilities that are focused on specific aspects of the applications.  

In contrast, there are already plenty of practical tools for testing and debugging web applications in general and many of them can be accessed directly from modern browsers. Google Chrome\footnote{\url{http://www.google.com/chrome/}} in particular, but to some extent also other browsers, provide quite mature tools for debugging JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, those tools are focused on debugging one device at a time, limiting their usefulness for testing cross-device applications where multiple devices are involved simultaneously.  Today's devices have many different characteristics, mainly in terms of screen size, but also concerning their input capabilities and connectivity. This diversity of devices has made it a requirement to develop websites that are functional and appealing on all devices. This goal can be achieved by following the principles of responsive design. Many tools have emerged that support testing of such websites; some are already built into modern web browsers while others can be accessed through a website or by installing a program on a desktop PC. In summary, those tools use two different approaches for testing responsive websites: First, different devices can be emulated on a desktop computer. Second, a varied set of actual devices can be used. Google Chrome's Device Mode\footnote{\url{https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode}} provides extensive support for emulating devices; apart from simply emulating the screen size, it can also emulate touch, varying network conditions, location, and more. Other browsers also provide basic facilities for device emulation. When using multiple devices, the developer has to refresh all devices individually whenever the web application has been modified. However, there exist a number of tools to facilitate this. Some allow the developer to reload all devices at once, e.g. Adobe Edge Inspect CC\footnote{\url{https://www.adobe.com/ch_de/products/edge-inspect.html}}, while others automatically reload devices when files change, e.g. BrowserSync\footnote{\url{http://www.browsersync.io/}}. Some of those tools even allow developers to simultaneously browse the web application on multiple devices. Apart from those tools, there are also web services for testing websites across multiple devices and platforms. Such web services typically include a screenshot generation service that renders a given website on a large number of devices. An example of such a web service is CrossBrowserTesting\footnote{\url{http://crossbrowsertesting.com/}}.

Those tools are already a good starting point for testing and debugging cross-device applications. However, cross-device applications and web applications targeted at one device at a time have some fundamental differences that are not accounted for by those tools. In cross-device applications, multiple devices are typically used simultaneously and in a coordinated manner. Also, different devices do not necessarily show the same thing in cross-device applications, which limits the use of mirroring interactions from one device to all other devices. Furthermore, most of the tools for emulating devices focus on emulating one device at a time, which requires the developer to open multiple browser windows, possibly with different user profiles or in incognito mode, as cross-device applications only become useful when multiple devices are involved at once. Finally, all those tools focus either on emulating devices or on using real devices, but with cross-device applications, it might be desirable to combine both approaches. Due to those differences, testing and debugging cross-device applications is still a challenging task. In the following section, we will describe how our project contributes to conquering the challenges in cross-device application testing and debugging.

\section{Contributions}

Our project aims to make it easier to test and debug cross-device applications. As a first step, we analyzed existing tools for debugging web applications. This includes tools built directly into browsers as well as external tools. Due to the similarities between cross-device applications and responsive web applications, tools for testing responsive websites are of particular interest. During the analysis, we gathered the limitations of those tools and possible solutions to those limitations regarding cross-device application testing. Furthermore, we also investigated some frameworks for developing cross-device applications. The inspection of those frameworks was done for two reasons: Firstly, we wanted to see if any of the frameworks already provide some useful for cross-device application testing. Second, we wanted to analyze how different frameworks could profit from a tool that facilitates cross-device application testing. Finally, we gathered some requirements for more suitable tools for cross-device application testing based on the limitations of existing tools.

Based on those requirements, we designed and implemented a new set of tools for testing and debugging cross-device applications. Those tools allow testing applications both on real devices and emulated devices. Our tools provide a number of different features: Some features have been adopted from other tools while others are based on some existing features but have been extended to suit the needs of cross-device application testing. Some features that only make sense in a cross-device environment are completely new and not based on any available features.

During the development of our tools, we also implemented two sample cross-device applications using XD-MVC\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mhusm/XD-MVC}}, a cross-device application development framework. Those applications should helped us in multiple ways while developing our tools: First, actually using our tools for developing cross-device applications provided some new ideas for crucial features that were still missing from our tools. Second, developing sample applications will helped us improve existing features and revealed some bugs in existing features. Finally, we will also learned something about the usability of our tool.

Eventually, we conducted a user study to evaluate the usefulness and suitability of the tool, comparing to traditional methods of testing web applications. During this study, participants got the opportunity to use our tools for implementing a new feature in a cross-device application and for finding and fixing a bug. This study showed that our tools are indeed considered useful for testing cross-device applications by our participants. Furthermore, some participants also provided some new ideas for features and improvements for our existing features as well as the layout of our tools.

In summary, our project makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analysis of the limitations of existing tools for web application testing in general as well as responsive design testing.
	\item Development of a set of tools for testing and debugging cross-device applications.
	\item Development of two sample cross-device applications.
	\item User study for evaluating our set of tools.
\end{itemize}
