\section{General}

As mentioned before, our set of tools should support emulating devices as well as connecting real devices. A lot of existing tools also have the possibility of reloading all devices at once. This should also be possible with our tools, as well as loading a specific URL on all devices. 

\section{Device Emulation}

(extendable) list of predefined devices
changing resolution
scaling devices
refreshing device
loading url
switching orientation

\subsection{Saving and Loading Device Configurations}

adding the same devices again every time you want to test an application is annoying
some applications use specific configurations

\section{Connecting Real Devices}

should be easy
every device has a camera --> scanning a qr code is easy
typing url as alternative for connecting devices without camera

\section{Shared JavaScript Console}

devtools console useful, but only for single device at a time
aggregate outputs from all devices, including remote devices
should include errors
send commands to all devices

\section{Function Debugging}
setting breakpoint on every device is annoying

TODO: do not forget to add HTML inspection in this section

\section{Shared CSS Editor}

\section{Record/Replay}
